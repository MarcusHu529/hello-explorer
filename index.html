    <h1>Earth</h1>

    <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
        This is made possible by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining 
        liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% 
        of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the 
        form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.
