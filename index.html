    Prompt: generate a fun fact of the sun 100 words

    <p>
        Did you know that the Sun accounts for a staggering 99.86% of the 
        total mass of our entire solar system? That means all the planets—including 
        massive Jupiter—moons, asteroids, and comets combined make up less than 0.2% of the system's "stuff."
        Because of this immense mass, the Sun has a powerful gravitational pull that 
        keeps everything from Mercury to the distant Oort Cloud in orbit. To visualize 
        this scale, if the Sun were a hollow ball, you could fit roughly 1.3 million Earths 
        inside it. It isn't just a star; it is truly the heavy anchor of our cosmic neighborhood.
