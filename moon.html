    <h1>Moon</h2>
    <p>
    The Moon is the only natural satellite of Earth. It orbits around Earth at an average distance 
    of 384,399 kilometres (238,854 mi),[f] a distance roughly 30 times the width of Earth. 
    It completes an orbit (lunar month) in relation to Earth and the Sun (synodically) every 29.5 days. 
    The Moon and Earth are bound by gravitational attraction, which is stronger on the sides facing each other. 
    The resulting tidal forces are the main driver of Earth's tides, and have pulled the Moon to always face 
    Earth with the same near side.
