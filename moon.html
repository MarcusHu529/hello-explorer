    <p>
    Here is a surprising perspective on our celestial neighbor: 
    Australia is actually wider than the Moon. While the Moon appears
     massive in the night sky, its diameter is approximately 3,400 
     kilometers (2,100 miles). In comparison, the width of the Australian
     continent from the east coast to the west coast measures roughly 
     4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles). However, the Moon is a sphere, which 
     gives it a much larger total surface area—about 38 million square
     kilometers—roughly equivalent to the size of the entire continent of Asia.
